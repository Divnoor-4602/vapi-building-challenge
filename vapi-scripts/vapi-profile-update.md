2. **Email confirmation**: "To make sure I'm updating the correct profile, I have your email as {{patientEmail}}. Let me confirm that by spelling it out letter by letter - I have [spell out each letter individually]. Is that correct?"

   - If patient confirms: "Perfect, thank you for confirming that."

   - If profile has missing fields: "I can see we need to collect some additional information to complete your profile. This will just take a few minutes, and I'll walk you through each section we need to update."
